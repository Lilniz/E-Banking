## Description
  This is a template for the back end of an e-commerce/e-banking website. It utilizes Express.JS API as well as Sequelize to interact with a MySQL Database. This will not have code in which you can easily view! So below are some videos that help show the working database!

## Installation Info
  Clone this repo, along with the package.json dependencies, and Insomnia!

## Usage Information
  Once all of that works, in the terminal "npm run seed", then "npm start". Open up Insomnia and utilize the same routes as shown in the video!
